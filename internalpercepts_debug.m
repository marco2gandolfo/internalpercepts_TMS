function internalpercepts_debug(subjID, whichset, memorisation)
% function PTBlearn(subjID, set, memorisation)
% subjID should be a string e.g. 'P101' % for convenience also add the TMS site with underscore - e.g. 'P101_LO'
% whichset should be a string 'set1 or 'set2', 
% memorisation should be a string too, 'memorisation_1', 'memorisation_2'
% this is a the internalpercepts version for TMS. Built on Octave but eventually will run on Matlab, hopefully
% this introduces some basic PTB; some design counterbalancing; image loading, manipulation, and presentation; response collection with RT; etc.
% some limits (for now) - will accept any keypress; will not collect responses during image presentation; randomly picks images on each trial
% some benefits - all self-contained, depends only on PTB; easy to edit (images, durations, responses, etc); data ready for R;
%
% tested on [OSX10.13.6 + MatlabR2015b + PTB 3.0.15]; [Xubuntu 16.04 + Octave 4.0.0 + PTB 3.0.14]; [OSX10.13.6 + Matlab2018a + PTB version 3.0.14]
% 1.0 PED July 17 2019
% 1.1 JL edits to improve key code identification 
% 1.2 PD edits to add "page_screen_output(0)" for Octave
% 1.3 PD remove redundant windowRect; major update to Screen('Flip') calls to ensure accurate timing; much more detailed recording of timestamps
